## 🤵🏻 Personal Profile

Born in 1994 in Zhejiang Province, China. Having won the first place in the middle school entrance examination, I was successfully admitted to Dongyang No. 1 Middle School, a key high school in the city. I graduated from Zhejiang University of Technology, a key university in the province. While studying, I actively participated in students'work. I did not let myself fail the course. I succeeded in getting the CET6 certificate, taking part-time jobs on campus and being the first person in charge of a school-level organization.

In 2015, the senior year mainly focused on internship. During this period, I constantly tried to find my own professional position, from the new media operation to Android development,and to iOS development. Finally, I formally contacted with the front-end development in February 2016. After graduation in June 2016, I worked as a full-time front-end development engineer, and went further and further on the road of front-end development, and fell deeper and deeper until I fell in love with this profession. In 2016, when the front-end field of three-legged (React/Vue/Angular), technological innovation is surging, and I was so young, high-spirited! 

At work, I am belong to introverted and quiet, while those in life, I am outgoing and lively. Usually, I always love to do things more seriously. I am more willing to pursue the essence of things to help me understand things. My favorite motto is that "Know what it is, know why it is, and know what it will be".

Interests and hobbies: Basketball, Movies, Reading, Travelling, and LOL.
